## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Workforce compensation structure is functioning correctly with geo-adjustment for BOTH base salary and equity. However, **35% of workforce below geo-adjusted equity targets**, **10 employees with zero equity**, and **performance data gaps** create significant retention risks. Brazil employees 56% below geo-adjusted equity targets while US employees 61% above targets.

## üìä Detailed Analysis Findings

### **Compensation Calculation Verification**
*Analysis confirmed geo-factor adjustments are working correctly*

| Employee | Country | Payband Base | Geo Factor | Adjusted Base | Current Base | Variance |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Employee 15 | Egypt | $245,000 | 0.5 | $122,500 | $122,500 | $0 |
| Employee 3 | United States | $300,000 | 1.0 | $300,000 | $309,000 | $9,000 |

**Key Finding:** Base compensation aligns with geo-adjusted paybands (average variance <$10K)

## üíé Equity Analysis - CORRECTED with Geo-Adjustment

### **MAJOR CORRECTION:** Equity IS Geo-Adjusted
**Previous analysis ERROR:** Compared absolute equity values, ignoring that equity targets are geo-adjusted like base salary.

### **Corrected Equity Positioning vs Geo-Adjusted Targets**

|--------|-------|----------------|
| Above geo-adjusted target | 34 | 50.0% |
| At target (¬±$10K) | 15 | 22.1% |
| Below geo-adjusted target | 24 | 35.3% |

**Average positioning:** +29.4% above geo-adjusted equity targets

### **Geographic Equity Analysis - CORRECTED**

| Country | Count | Current Avg | Target Avg | Gap % |
|---------|-------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Brazil | 12 | $75,438 | $185,070 | **-56%** |

## üéØ Enhanced Action Plan

### **PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE (30 Days)**

#### **Priority 1: Early Career Retention Crisis**
- **IMMEDIATE:** Review 13 employees in 3-6 month tenure (highest risk group)
- **Action:** Implement equity acceleration or one-time grants to bridge compensation cliff
- **Budget estimate:** $150K in equity/bonuses to retain early-career talent

#### **Priority 2: Performance Review Emergency**
- **URGENT:** Complete reviews for ALL 16 employees <6 months tenure (100% missing data)
- **Timeline:** 1 week maximum  
- **Impact:** Cannot assess retention risk without performance baseline

#### **Priority 3: Equity Distribution Crisis**
- **IMMEDIATE:** Address 10 employees with ZERO equity (across all geographies)
- **Brazil Focus:** Systematic 56% equity shortfall needs correction ($1.3M total gap)
- **US Review:** 61% over-equity may indicate budget reallocation opportunity
- **Budget estimate:** $300K equity grants to correct zero-equity and Brazil gaps

### **PHASE 2: STRATEGIC (60-90 Days)**

#### **Equity Structure Overhaul**
1. **Equity Distribution Analysis - CORRECTED**
   - **CONFIRMED:** Equity IS geo-adjusted (intentional policy)
   - **Issue:** Implementation gaps causing zero equity and country-specific shortfalls
   - **Focus:** Fix individual positioning vs geo-adjusted targets, not geographic policy

2. **Geographic Equity Rebalancing**
   - **Brazil correction program:** Address 56% systematic shortfall
   - **US equity audit:** Review 61% over-allocation for potential rebalancing
   - **Zero equity emergency:** Immediate grants for 10 employees

## üìã Recommended Policy Changes

### **Compensation Philosophy Clarification**
1. **Equity Distribution Policy**
   - Define whether equity should be geo-adjusted or performance-based
   - Current disparity suggests lack of clear policy

2. **Total Compensation Approach**
   - Consider total comp (cash + equity) for retention decisions
   - Current cash-only focus misses major retention lever

### **Performance Management**
1. **Mandatory Performance Review Completion**
   - 100% review completion requirement
   - Quarterly performance check-ins for high performers

2. **Manager Effectiveness Metrics**
   - Track manager performance correlation with team attrition
   - Currently no concentrated high-attrition managers identified
